I am a master's student in Applied Physics. Describing the world in a quantitative way and learning about the system's behaviour by modelling is why I like studying physics.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, hiking, playing football, padel and other ball games.

Some notable courses I have had in Master's are
- scientific computing [<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/mikk-kruusalu/scientific_computing), where we had three finite element projects on the High Performance Cluster.
- Deep Learning [<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/mikk-kruusalu/deep_learning_project), where we explored several different neural network architectures by defining and training these on individual projects
- Numerical Methods, where we implemented different numerical schemes to solving Partial Differential Equations (PDE), this was continuance on the analytical PDE course.

My thesis [<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/mikk-kruusalu/heimburg_jackson) focused on modelling nerve signals and focused on the derivation of the governing equations and solving a PDE with different parametrs to understand the equations behaviour.

Some notable courses I had include
- basic *mathematics*, such as linear algebra, caclulus I and II, complex analysis, odrinary differential equations, numerical methods,
- basics in *classical physics*, such as mechanics, electrodynamics, optics, thermodynamics, etc.
- basics in *data science*, such as probability theory, statistical methods and machine learning.
