## Material properties

The problem was to find the effective Young's modulus and Poisson coefficient of a composite material.
The case was set up such that we had a block of matrix material inside which there are 5 parallel fibres that have high Young's modulus and low Poisson coefficient.
The mesh on @fig-mesh was generated with Gmsh.

The simulations were performed using ElmerFEM.

## Heatsink

The problem was to find the steady state temperature distribution of a given heatsink if the heating power was 100 W. The simulation result is on @fig-heatsink.
The simulation was done using OpenFOAM.
