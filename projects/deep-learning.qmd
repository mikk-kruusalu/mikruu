In this course I had to sumbit 2 course works which included experimenting with different neural network architectures, such as

- convolutional,
- recurrent,
- graph message passing,
- autoencoder,
- generative adversarial networks and
- physics informed networks.

All the code for running these models are in two repositories, the reports can be found in the root of the repositories. [Project 1](https://github.com/mikk-kruusalu/deep_learning_project) and [Project 2](https://github.com/mikk-kruusalu/deep_learning_project2).
