Since measurements show accompaning effects to the electrical pulse, they need to be studied as well. The main effect I studied was longitudinal wave in a myelinated axon. For this I used the improved Heimbur-Jackson equation \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{tt} &= [(c_{0}^{2} + pu + qu^{2})u_{x}]_x - h_{1}u_{xxxx} + h_{2}u_{xxtt} + a_1 \\phi_x \\\\\n\\phi_{tt} &= c_1^2 \\phi_{xx} - \\eta^2 \\phi - a_2 u_x.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The idea was to study the behaviour of this system of equations.

    "text": "Naive approach\nWe seek for the solution \\(y(x)\\), exactly one \\(y\\) for each \\(x\\). From the Pythagoras we have \\[\n\\D s = \\D x \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} \\right)^2 }.\n\\] Notice that when we divide both equations of system Equation 1 by \\(\\D x\\) we have the definition of the derivative on the left side \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\D T_x}{\\D x} &= \\rho g \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} \\right)^2 } \\\\\n\\frac{\\D T_y}{\\D x} &= -f_w.\n\\end{align*}\n\\] The second equation is easily solved and the solution is \\[\nT_y = -f_w (x - \\bar{x}),\n\\] where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the integration constant. The solution is a linear function that crosses zero at \\(\\bar{x}\\). Since in the rope the forces always have to be tangential to it, the only place where \\(y\\) component will be zero is the extremal point. From the defintions of the force components we have that \\(T_x = T_y/\\tan\\alpha = T_y / (dy/dx)\\). Using the chain rule the first equation becomes \\[\n\\frac{\\D T_y}{\\D x} \\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} - T_y \\frac{\\D^2y}{\\D x^2} = \\rho g \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} \\right)^2 } \\left( \\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} \\right)^2.\n\\] Since we know \\(T_y\\) we can replace it and have our final equation \\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n  -\\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} + (x - \\bar{x}) \\frac{\\D^2y}{\\D x^2} = \\kappa \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} \\right)^2 } \\left( \\frac{\\D y}{\\D x} \\right)^2, \\\\\n  l = \\int_0^{x_0} \\D s.\n\\end{gathered}\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\(\\kappa = \\rho g / f_w\\) is a constant. This is a pretty complicated differential equation! And notice that we still do not know \\(\\bar{x}\\) but it has a very clear physical meaning. So in order to get a solvable system we need the length constraint.\n\nProblems\nSolving this equation was a nightmare! I tried every possible method I knew for boundary value problems.\nI started by using finite differences. The optimiser optimistix.IndirectLevenbergMarquardt worked reasonably well, but I had to lower the tolerances to \\(10^{-3}\\). It works for some very specific parameters but the final solution depends heavily on the initial guess. I used a second order polynomial with roots at the boundaries and the solution differs when scaling the initial guess.\nTo my surprise, shooting method worked better in the sense that it found only one correct solution. But it worked in an even smaller region of parameters. The reason I was surprised was because if you write the Equation 2 in the form of first order differential equation system standard form, then it involves division by \\((x-\\bar{x})\\) which includes division by zero at \\(\\bar{x}\\). But the solver handled it nicely if I added \\(\\varepsilon=10^{-4}\\) to both the nominator and denominator. From the physics we know that \\(\\D y/\\D x=0\\) at \\(\\bar{x}\\)."

    "text": "Parametric equation\nSince there were a few problems with Equation 2, I needed to approach the problem from a different angle. So instead of solving for \\(y(x)\\), now we solve for \\((x(s), y(s))\\), where \\(s\\) is the cable length. This is beneficial because with high wind speed or very loose cable, the lower end will naturally want to drop down which would mean there are two \\(y\\)-s for each \\(x\\).\nInstead of expressing the derivatives in \\(x\\) we now divide the force balance Equation 1 by \\(\\D s\\) \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\D T_x}{\\D s} &= \\rho g \\\\\n  \\frac{\\D T_y}{\\D s} &= f_w \\frac{\\D x}{\\D s}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] From Figure 1 one can easily derive the geometric constraints for the Cartesian coordinates \\[\n\\frac{\\D x}{\\D s} = \\cos{\\alpha} \\qquad \\frac{dy}{ds} = \\sin{\\alpha}.\n\\] Since the tension in the rope and the vector \\((\\D x, \\D y)\\) both have to be tangential to the rope, a similar relationship holds for tension \\[\n\\cos{\\alpha} = \\frac{T_x}{\\sqrt{T_x^2 + T_y^2}} \\qquad\n\\sin{\\alpha} = \\frac{T_y}{\\sqrt{T_x^2 + T_y^2}}.\n\\] So putting it all together we get a system of four equations \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\frac{\\D x}{\\D s} &= \\frac{T_x}{T} &\n  \\frac{\\D y}{\\D s} &= \\frac{T_y}{T} \\\\\n  \\frac{\\D T_x}{\\D s} &= \\rho g &\n  \\frac{\\D T_y}{\\D s} &= f_w \\frac{T_x}{T}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\] This system looks much easier than the one for finding \\(y(x)\\) Equation 2."
